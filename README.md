# Modern Slide In - Sequence.js Theme

> A minimalist theme for showcasing products. Images and text become opaque as they slide in. Each pagination link is a preview of a steps product image.

This theme is powered by [Sequence.js](http://sequencejs.com/) - The responsive CSS animation framework for creating unique sliders, presentations, banners, and other step-based applications.

## Getting Started

To add a Sequence.js theme to your web page, complete the following:

1. Download and unzip your theme
2. Move the `modern-slide-in` folder to the same folder as the page you'd like the Sequence.js theme to appear on
3. Add the theme's stylesheet within the `<head></head>` tags on your page, below existing stylesheets. For example:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="modern-slide-in/css/sequence-theme.modern-slide-in.css" />
```

4. From `modern-slide-in/index.html`, copy everything inside the `<body></body>` tags, then paste into the page you'd like the theme to appear on.
5. From `modern-slide-in/index.html`, copy any `<script></script>` elements found toward the bottom of the page and paste just before the closing `</body>` tag. This should include a reference to the Sequence.js library, its third-party dependencies, and the theme's options, for example:
```html
<script src="modern-slide-in/scripts/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script>
<script src="modern-slide-in/scripts/hammer.min.js"></script>
<script src="modern-slide-in/scripts/sequence.min.js"></script>
<script src="modern-slide-in/scripts/sequence-theme.modern-slide-in.js"></script>
```

6. Save your file and view in the browser. You're done!

7. *Optional*: Internet Explorer 8 will show the mobile layout regardless of browser width. If you'd like to fix that, add a reference to [respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) after all references to CSS. This will add media query support to older browsers. For example:

  ```javascript
  <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="modern-slide-in/scripts/respond.min.js"></script>
  <![endif]-->
  ```

### Customizing a Theme

To customize how a theme behaves, its Sequence.js options can be changed in `modern-slide-in/scripts/sequence-theme.modern-slide-in.js`. See Options in the [documentation](http://www.sequencejs.com/documentation/#options).

To customize how a theme looks and how its step's transition, refer to the theme's stylesheet: `modern-slide-in/css/sequence-theme.modern-slide-in.css`.

It is recommended to read [Setting Up a Theme](http://www.sequencejs.com/documentation/#setting-up-a-theme) in the documentation for an overview of how transitions are applied to Sequence.js steps.

## Using Grunt.js to Develop a Theme

If you are familiar with Grunt.js, you can use it to automate common development tasks. This however is optional and isn't required for a theme to work.

Sequence.js and the themes it powers use [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate useful tasks. With Grunt.js installed (see Grunt.js' [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)), use the following command to install this theme's development dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Once development dependencies have installed you can use the commands `grunt serve` and `grunt`.

### `grunt serve`

This command will start a development environment with the following automated tasks:

- Starts a [livereload](http://livereload.com/) session that will reload your browser whenever a file is changed (be sure to install [livereload](http://livereload.com/))
- Opens your browser and navigates to `http://localhost:8000/`
- Sets up a *watch* task to run the following sub-tasks:
  - Update the version number of the following files when changed in `package.json`:
    - `scripts/sequence-theme.modern-slide-in.js`
    - `scss/sequence-theme.modern-slide-in.scss`
    - `css/sequence-theme.modern-slide-in.css`
    - `bower.json`
  - Process any `.scss` files found in the `scss` directory, autoprefix them and then copy to `css` and minify
  - Refresh the browser when any changes are made in HTML, JS, CSS, or SCSS files

You only need to run `grunt serve` per each development session as the *watch* task will continue to operate as you modify files.

### `grunt`

The `grunt` command is a manual version of the *watch* sub tasks listed for the `grunt serve` command.
